### Brief Summary:  
  
* Improved intelligence of Yelp recommendation system by designing a **content-based recommendation algorithm** to recommend similar restaurants users have visited based on categories as well as locations.

* Developed a **web service** using **Java** servlet and **IOS** mobile app with Swift. Fetched data from Yelp **RESTful API**.

* Implemented responsive web page and animation effects using **AJAX**, **AngularJS** and **Bootstrap**.

* Tested both **MongoDB** and **MySQL** to store user preference and restaurant data. After comparison, MongoDB showed better performance in storing JSON data received from Yelp API.

* Deployed server side to **AWS** EC2. 130 queries can be processed per second according to Apache JMeter test.
