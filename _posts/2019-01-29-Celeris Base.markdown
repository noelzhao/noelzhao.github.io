### Brief Summary:  
  
* Migrated and remodeled a **water waves simulation** software (**C++** and **OpenGL** based) to **C#** and **Unity** platform.

* Redesigned and implemented user interface for Windows client. Controlled the UI animation flow using coroutine.

* Developed an interactive topography **AR sandbox** to demonstrate wave simulation.

* Utilized **Kinect** to detect and gather topographic changing data in sandbox. Used **C++** and **OpenCV** to write gradient colormap computation engine which generated real-time topographic rendering color based on sand height.

* Refactored code with **object-oriented** design and **MVC** pattern. Reduced scripting files size by 50%.

* The new version provided Windows and Oculus compatibility and professional software visualization quality to hundreds of researchers and engineering firm users in 50+ countries.
